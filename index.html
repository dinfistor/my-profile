				<h2>✈️ Travelling ✈️</h2>
				<p>In 17 years of life, I have had the chance to travel a lot, whether for sports, for school or simply with my family. First of all, travel, for me, is something that allows me to feel a lot of different emotions, to understand and review history, to discover the world, to meet new people. But also, traveling allows me above all to open my eyes to the really important things like freedom, equality, and life in general.  I visited <strong>55 countries</strong> and I understood  that each country has its culture, its traditions, its architecture, its problems. People are different, have different mentalities. I can't imagine my life without travelling and I'm very happy to have the opportunity to travel.

				<h3> 🏆 Sports 🏆</h3>
				<p>Since I was a child I have loved sport, especially football. At the age of 7 I joined my first team and until I was 16 I played this sport at a professional level. I am good at team sports in general because I like to have teammates and to work out tactics together. Today, I continue to practice sports: I go to the gym and I am part of the ESSEC football team. In winter, I love to ski, it allows me to relax and regain my senses.</p>
